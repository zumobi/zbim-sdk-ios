## Overview

This document provides an overview of ZBi for Marketers (ZBiM) SDK and describes the way it can be integrated into and interacted with by a client application.

The ZBiM SDK provides the ability to deliver tailored content inside a native application, where the content is managed directly by the marketing team responsible for the application. The goal is to bridge the gap between content creation and content delivery in an intuitive, transparent, and scalable way while allowing for personalization based on analyzing users' behaviors without involving the application development team or IT beyond the initial SDK integration.

Below is a high level diagram that describes the path that the content travels through the ZBiM Platform from the content source to the SDK integrated inside your native application:

![ZUMOBI PUBLISHING ENGINE][diagram1]
<p style="text-align:center; width=100%;">ZUMOBI PUBLISHING ENGINE</p>

In the above diagram, the Zumobi Publishing Engine fetches content (this content can be from your CMS, a Zumobi content partner, a social media source, or the Zumobi cloud-based CMS), processes it into a secure form by applying pre-crafted Content Hub templates, and delivers the rendered content bundle to the SDK over a trusted pipeline for creating the custom-crafted, walled-garden experience within your native application.

<a id="Requirements"/>
## Requirements

ZBiM SDK requires:
* Xcode 5 or later
* iOS 7 or later.

<a id="ProjectSetup"/>
## Project Setup

ZBiM SDK uses CocoaPods as a distribution mechanism. If you are not familiar with CocoaPods, please refer to https://cocoapods.org for more information.

To integrate ZBiM SDK into an existing iOS project, add the following to your Podfile and run 'pod install':

```
  pod "ZBiM-SDK-iOS", :git => 'https://github.com/zumobi/zbim-sdk-ios.git', :tag => '1.2'
```

<a id="QuickStart"/>
## Quick Start

Here's the minimum set of steps required to get a Content Hub up and running:

1. Include the following Zumobi-provided files as part of your application's bundle:
  * zbimconfig.plist
  * pubkey.der
2. Initialize the ZBiM SDK and set an active user. Inside your AppDelegate class add the following:

  ```objective-c
  #import "ZBiM.h"

  - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
  {
      // Initialize SDK.
      [ZBiM start];

      // Set active user.
      if (![ZBiM activeUser])
      {
          NSError *error = nil;
          NSString *userID = [ZBiM generateDefaultUserId];
          if (![ZBiM createUser:userID withTags:nil error:&error])
          {
              NSLog(@"Failed creating user: %@", error);
          }
          else
          {
              if (![ZBiM setActiveUser:userID error:&error])
              {
                  NSLog(@"Failed setting active user: %@", error);
              }
          }
      }

      // ...

      return YES;
  }
  ```

3. Create an entry point for the Content Hub, e.g. a button, whose touch-up-inside action handler is defined as follows:

  ```objective-c
  - (IBAction)showContentHubPressed:(id)sender
  {
      [ZBiM presentHub:^(BOOL success, NSError *error) {
          if (!success)
          {
              NSLog(@"Failed presenting content hub. Error: %@", error);
          }
      }];
  }

  ```

<a id="Initialization"/>
## SDK Initialization

Include the ZBiM.h header in the source where you will be using the ZBiM SDK with the following directive:â€¨#import "ZBiM.h".

To use the ZBiM SDK, it must first be initialized by calling:

```objective-c
+ (void) start;
```

This is done once per application session and is recommended that it is done as early as possible, e.g. inside:

```objective-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    [ZBiM start];
    // ...
    return YES;
}
```

The first time the SDK is initialized, the client application must create a user ID and set it as the active user. This user ID is used for tracking the user's activity while interacting with the Content Hub experience for metrics reporting and content tailoring purposes. The user ID is used in an anonymous fashion and the SDK has a built-in mechanism (described below) to generate a new user ID for this purpose if you do not have or cannot use an existing user ID.

If the client application allows multiple users to be logged in over time, a different user ID can be registered with the SDK and associated with each application user, enabling the SDK to preserve tailoring data in case a previously registered user comes back. An important thing to note is that while there can be multiple user IDs registered with the SDK, only one of them can be active at any point in time.

To create a new user, call:

```objective-c
+ (BOOL) createUser:(NSString *)userId withTags:(NSArray *)tags error:(NSError * __autoreleasing *)error;
```

**Note:** See [User Tags & Content Tailoring](#UserTagsContentTailoring) for more details on the second parameter.

If the application already has the concept of a user ID, e.g. the application requires the user to login to access services provided by the application, the application can pass that value (username or assigned unique identifier) as the ZBiM user ID.

It is important to note that it is the application's responsibility to ensure that no personally identifiable information is passed to ZBiM SDK. The username provided will be used as-is and no attempt at obfuscating the value will be made by the ZBiM SDK.

Alternatively the application can call the following method provided by the ZBiM SDK to have a new user ID generated on its behalf:

```objective-c
+ (NSString *) generateDefaultUserId;
```

Once the user ID has been created, the application must call the following method in order to instruct the SDK to start using the newly created user ID:

```objective-c
+ (BOOL) setActiveUser:(NSString *)userId error:(NSError * __autoreleasing *)error;
```

The client application can check if there is an active user already set by calling:

```objective-c
+ (NSString *) activeUser;
```

To summarize, the pattern looks as follows:

```objective-c
if (![ZBiM activeUser])
{
    NSError *error = nil;
    NSString *userID = [ZBiM generateDefaultUserId];
    if (![ZBiM createUser:userID withTags:nil error:&error])
    {
        NSLog(@"Failed creating user: %@", error);
    }
    else
    {
        if (![ZBiM setActiveUser:userID error:&error])
        {
            NSLog(@"Failed setting active user: %@", error);
        }
    }
}
```

<a id="UserTagsContentTailoring"/>
## User Tags & Content Tailoring

Tags are strings associated with individual pieces of content and are central to delivering a tailored content experience. As a user consumes content, the associated tags are used to build a user profile, which informs future content selection that is tailored to the user's preferences. A newly created user ID has no tagging data associated with it, unless the application passes a set of tags as a parameter. This initial set allows the ZBiM SDK to customize the experience for the given user from the start. This is optional and can be left out if tagging data is not available, in which case the ZBiM SDK will start building a user profile from scratch and gradually improve the content's relevancy as it learns more about the user.

Tags' values are entirely up to the client application and corresponding content provider and can be any string value that clearly describes the content or the user consuming it, e.g. "cooking recipe", "sports fan" or "high net worth individual", etc. Here are a few best practices when coming up with tags:

1. The client application and the content source must agree on the exact same set of tags. Any discrepancies may affect the ZBiM SDK's ability to tailor content.
2. The tags should have the right 'granularity' to allow better content tailoring. For example if there are three American football related articles, tagging all three with say "football" will yield better results than tagging them "Seahawks" (too specific), "football" and "sports" (too general).

If the application needs access to the set of tags for a given user ID, it can get it by calling:

```objective-c
+ (NSArray *)tagsForUser:(NSString *)userId error:(NSError * __autoreleasing *)error;
```

The application also has the option to get the corresponding usage counts for each tag in a user's profile by calling:

```objective-c
+ (NSDictionary *)tagUsageCountsForUser:(NSString *)userId error:(NSError * __autoreleasing *)error;
```

The return value is a dictionary of tag/usage count data, associated with given user ID. And if the application needs to update the user's tags profile it can do so by calling:

```objective-c
+ (BOOL)updateTagUsageCounts:(NSDictionary *)tags error:(NSError * __autoreleasing *)error;
```

The dictionary passed as a parameter contains tag/usage count data, where the given usage count is added/subtracted to/from the existing tag usage count. If a tag's usage count drops to 0 or below, the tag is deleted. All tag updates affect the current active user's profile.

<a id="ContentStructure"/>
## Content Structure

When content feeds are presented in-app to a user via the ZBiM SDK, we call this area of the application a Content Hub. In some cases, a brand might have multiple Content Hubs, which are expressed in one or more individual applications.

Content is organized logically in a hierarchy. The Content Hub loads data from a content source. A content source can have one or more hubs. A hub can have one or more channels and each channel can have one or more articles.

At each level of the hierarchy there is a set of tags associated with the corresponding item, e.g. hub, channel or article. When the time comes for the SDK to decide which hub to show or how to priority-order articles inside a channel these tags are compared against the set of tags associated with the current active user.

<a id="ContentDelivery"/>
## Content Delivery

This section covers two main aspects of getting content, which are:

1. Who is allowed to get content
2. When is content to be retrieved and how often

An application hosting a properly configured instance of the ZBiM SDK will have access to content at all times, unless the application's owner choses to limit access to only a subset via a pilot program. A typical usage scenario involves a company that wants to test a Content Hub on a subset of its user base, e.g. every one in ten users will see a Content Hub. A pilot program is configured entirely on the server side. If an instance of the host application is declined access to a pilot program, e.g. because all available slots have been filled, then a call to any of the presentHub* methods will return ZBiMErrorNotPartOfPilotProgram. The application can also check for a pilot program membership status by querying the value of the notPartOfPilotProgram property or by observing the ZBiMNotPartOfPilotProgramStateChanged notification. If the application has been successfully enrolled in a pilot program or if there is no pilot program at all, then the value of the notPartOfPilotProgram property will be false. If an application determines that it failed to enroll in an existing pilot program then it may want to hide the Content Hub's entry point(s). Also just because an application is currently enrolled in a pilot program it should not assume that its place is guaranteed for the entire duration of the program. The server can reset a pilot program at any point, asking everyone to reenroll, which is why the application should check the SDK's state regularly or register for the corresponding notification.

While the pilot program is controlled on the server side, there are a few pieces of data a pilot program may need as input when deciding whether to enroll a specific instance of the application. These are:

1. Current geolocation, expressed as a longitude/latitude pair.
2. Location ID, which is an application-defined string and takes precedence over the geolocation coordinates if both are provided.

To access a device's geolocation, code must first ask for permission to do so from the user. The SDK tries to avoid asking for anything on behalf of the client application, so instead of requesting location access itself, the SDK delegates the task to the application. For this to work the application has to provide a delegate of type that implements the ZBiMLocationServiceDelegate protocol, which is defined as follows:

```objective-c
@protocol ZBiMLocationServiceDelegate <NSObject>
- (void)fetchLocation:(ZBiMLocationServiceCallback)callback;
@end
```

The reasoning is that the SDK does not know enough about the context it is running into and asking for permission from the user may be undesirable. The application may decide that using a third-party service based on IP address to get only coarse location is sufficient, e.g. determine only the name of the city the user is in. In that case there's no need to ask for permission at all.

To set the location service delegate, the application must call the following method:

```objective-c
+ (void)setLocationServiceDelegate:(id<ZBiMLocationServiceDelegate>)locationServiceDelegate;
```

The host application communicates back the current location via a callback method defined as follows:

```objective-c
typedef void (^ZBiMLocationServiceCallback)(CLLocation *location, NSString*locationID);
```

The SDK will then pass the location data to the backend service, where it will be compared against the pilot program settings to determine if a given instance of the application can be enrolled to the pilot program or not. If the application decides to go with the location ID option, the data will be compared verbatim against the pilot program settings. If both geolocation data and location ID are available, then location ID takes precedence. By providing a location ID, the application is telling the SDK that it knows better how to describe the user's location. The important thing to remember is that location ID is used verbatim. E.g. if pilot program targets users from "Seattle, WA", then passing location ID of "Seattle" or "Seattle, Washington" or a zip code of 98121 will not work.

Once it has been determined that an application is eligible to receive content, the next step is figuring out an answer to the following questions:

1. When should content first be downloaded? If the concern is that not all users will end up opening a Content Hub, then it might make sense to download content only when a user has expressed an explicit interest. If on the other hand it is essential to have content downloaded by the time the user is ready to consume it, then scheduling a download as soon as the SDK is initialized makes more sense. By default, content is downloaded on demand, i.e. when the user has explicitly ask for a Content Hub.
2. If previously downloaded content is already available on the device, is it acceptable to present it to the user while new content is being downloaded. If that's not the case, the alternatives are to either schedule a recurring background download that ensures fresh content is always present or to show a progress indicator and ask the user to wait until new content is downloaded before it can be presented. By default, if previously downloaded content is available it will be presented immediately and new content, if any, will be downloaded in the background.

Both settings are controlled remotely and cannot be set programmatically inside the application. Their values can however be inspected by the host application via the following methods:

```objective-c
+ (ZBiMInitialContentDownloadMode) initialContentDownloadMode;
+ (ZBiMContentRefreshMode) contentRefreshMode;
+ (NSTimeInterval) contentRefreshInterval;
```

Applicable values for ZBiMInitialContentDownloadMode are:
  * ZBiMInitialContentDownloadModeImmediate
  * ZBiMInitialContentDownloadModeOnDemand

Applicable values for ZBiMContentRefreshMode are:
  * ZBiMContentRefreshModeDontShowStale
  * ZBiMContentRefreshModeStaleOK
  * ZBiMContentRefreshModeRecurring

<a id="ContentHUBNavigationModel"/>
## Content Hub UI & Navigation Model

Content is presented to the user inside a Content Hub, which can be in the form of a modal view, taking over the entire screen, or nested inside a parent view, provided by the client application. It is up to the application to decide which mode is more appropriate in the context of what it is trying to achieve.

To display the Content Hub as a modal view, call:

```objective-c
+ (void) presentHub:(void (^)(BOOL success, NSError *error))completionCallback;
```

By default the ZBiM SDK will find a presenting view controller on behalf of the host application and use it. If you need to override the default behavior, call:

```objective-c
+ (void) presentHubWithPresentingViewController:(UIViewController *)presentingViewController
                                     completion:(void (^)(BOOL success, NSError *error))completionCallback;
```

To present the Content Hub nested in a parent view, call:

```objective-c
+ (id<ZBiMContentHubDelegate>) presentHubWithParentView:(UIView *)parentView
                             parentViewController:(UIViewController *)parentViewController
                                       completion:(void (^)(BOOL success, NSError *error))completionCallback;
```

By default, when presented, the Content Hub will load the hub page that best matches the set of tags associated with the current active user. If tags are not available, then the first available hub page will be selected, based on internal ordering specified in the content bundle.

There are two variations of the above three methods, which allow changing the hub page selection logic. These allow passing a specific URI, which can point to a hub, channel or article page or a set of tags, which will override the tags associated with current active user, which are used to select the most relevant hub page to load.

To display the Content Hub as a modal view using a tags override, call:

```objective-c
+ (void) presentHubWithTags:(NSArray *)tags
                              completion:(void (^)(BOOL success, NSError *error))completionCallback;
```

To present the Content Hub as a modal view using a tags override and passing a presenting view controller, call:

```objective-c
+ (void) presentHubWithTags:(NSArray *)tags
      presentingViewController:(UIViewController *)presentingViewController
                              completion:(void (^)(BOOL success, NSError *error))completionCallback;
```

To present the Content Hub nested in a parent view, using a tags override, call:

```objective-c
+ (id<ZBiMContentHubDelegate>) presentHubWithTags:(NSArray *)tags
                                              parentView:(UIView *)parentView
                             parentViewController:(UIViewController *)parentViewController
                                              completion:(void (^)(BOOL success, NSError *error))completionCallback;
```

To present the Content Hub as a modal view using an URI override, call:

```objective-c
+ (void) presentHubWithUri:(NSString *)uri
                          completion:(void (^)(BOOL success, NSError *error))completionCallback;

```

To present the Content Hub as a modal view using an URI override and passing a presenting view controller, call:

```objective-c
+ (void) presentHubWithUri:(NSString *)uri
  presentingViewController:(UIViewController *)presentingViewController
                          completion:(void (^)(BOOL success, NSError *error))completionCallback;
```

To present the Content Hub nested in a parent view, using an URI override, call:

```objective-c
+ (id<ZBiMContentHubDelegate>) presentHubWithUri:(NSString *)uri
                                      parentView:(UIView *)parentView
                     parentViewController:(UIViewController *)parentViewController
                                      completion:(void (^)(BOOL success, NSError *error))completionCallback;
```

In the case where a previously presented Content Hub has been dismissed and a strong reference to it has been kept around, call the presentExistingContentHub:completion: method. That way, users can continue interacting with the Content Hub where they left off:

```objective-c
+ (void) presentExistingContentHub:(id<ZBiMContentHubDelegate>)existingContentHub
                        completion:(void (^)(BOOL success, NSError *error))completionCallback;
```

An application can have multiple entry points for the same Content Hub. If distinguishing among these for the purpose of metrics reporting is important, the application can use the following method to identify each entry point that it cares about.

```objective-c
+ (void) setContentHubEntryPoint:(NSString *)entryPoint;
```

The entry point identifier can be any string value that is meaningful to the client application. The application can choose to identify only some of the entry points and to even assign the same identifier to more than one entry point. The method should be called immediately before requesting a Content Hub to be presented. The identifier will be reset as soon as it has been used, so
 it does not affect subsequent attempts at presenting a Content Hub. The application needs to set the value explicitly every time it is needed.

The method calls presenting the hub as a nested view return a reference to an object implementing the ZBiMContentHubDelegate protocol. The protocol defines the following methods for interacting with the Content Hub:

```objective-c
- (void) goBack;
- (BOOL) canGoBack;
- (void) goForward;
- (BOOL) canGoForward;
- (BOOL) dismiss:(NSError * __autoreleasing *)error;
- (void) setScrollDelegate:(id<UIScrollViewDelegate>)delegate;
- (void) setBackgroundColor:(UIColor *)color;
- (void) loadContentWithURI:(NSString *)uri;
```

The reason for the remainder of the methods to not return the same type of object is that in the context of a full-screen Content Hub all related work is done internally. If for any reason the client application must get a reference to the current Content Hub, it can use the following method:

```objective-c
+ (id<ZBiMContentHubDelegate>) getCurrentContentHub;
```

ZBiM SDK keeps all navigation internal to the Content Hub except for the following cases:

1. Videos are played full-screen in a separate native modal view.
2. Clicking on external links will prompt the user to leave the application and be navigated to the default browser.
3. Clicking on a link which implements a custom scheme, e.g. zbim_sample_app://URI will provide the capability of Content Hub to talk back to the application, notifying the application of an action that it needs to handle.

Only one Content Hub can be shown by the SDK at any point in time. Multiple side-by-side hubs or stack of hubs displayed on top of each other are not supported.

The default Content Hub view has a predefined user interface (close, back buttons, ZBiM logo). In case the application wants to customize the Content Hub UI so it fits more seamlessly with the rest of the UI, the application should provide a parent view and corresponding parent view controller and the Content Hub will insert itself, taking 100% of the provided view and not showing any buttons. It is the application's responsibility to show the corresponding navigation buttons and connect them to the methods exposed by the ZBiMContentHubDelegate protocol.

Please note that when using the above-mentioned mode (where the Content Hub is hosted inside an application-provided parent view), it is not enough to simply dismiss the parent view's controller and rely on it doing all the necessary cleanup for you. It is imperative that application code (typically part of the parent view's controller) must call the ZBiMContentHubDelegate's dismiss method, i.e.:

```objective-c
- (BOOL) dismiss:(NSError * __autoreleasing *)error;
```

on the object implementing the ZBiMContentHubDelegate protocol. If the Content Hub is to be permanently dismissed, the application must not keep any strong references to the object implementing the ZBiMContentHubDelegate, so it can be properly accounted for and disposed of. If on the other hand the application intends to keep the Content Hub around and present it again in the future, then application code must still call the dismiss method, but keep a strong reference around. When the application is ready to have the Content Hub presented again, it should call:

```objective-c
+ (void) presentExistingContentHub:(id<ZBiMContentHubDelegate>)existingContentHub
                        completion:(void (^)(BOOL success, NSError *error))completionCallback;
```

In certain cases an embedded Content Hub may need to communicate back to its parent view controller, informing it that the Content Hub needs to have a certain action performed on its behalf. That's done by having the host application provide as delegate a class that implements the ZBiMContentHubContainerDelegate protocol. The reasoning for this design is that the parent view controller knows best how to perform certain actions and these should be delegated to it. The ZBiMContentHubContainerDelegate protocol is defined as follows:

```objective-c
@protocol ZBiMContentHubContainerDelegate <NSObject>
- (void) closeContentHub;
@optional
- (void) updateControls;
@end
```

Let's take as an example dismissing the Content Hub from within the Content Hub's embedded view controller. To do this properly, the Content Hub needs to figure out how the container view controller was presented, e.g. if it was presented modally, pushed on a navigation controller or added as a child of another view controller. The Content Hub will also need to decide if it needs to dismiss only itself or if the container view controller should be dismissed as well. The Content Hub also needs to account for how dismissing the container view controller should be animated, if at all. Finally, the Content Hub will have to know whether it will be reused in the future, in which the strong reference to it must be preserved or if it is no longer needed and should thus be discarded. Clearly these are all decisions better suited for the container view controller to take care of.

Progress updates, e.g. indicating that new content is being downloaded, will be displayed inside the Content Hub UI. If content cannot be presented for any reason, a message will be displayed inside the Content Hub UI, informing users that an error occurred. The Content Hub has generic views for all status-related UI. The host application can, however, register itself as a provider of such views and override the ones provided by default. For more details please see Customizations section.

## Security

Zumobi realizes the sensitive nature of serving content within the framework of an existing application and the various degrees to which a client application can be affected by a malicious or otherwise inappropriate content being served.

We take security very seriously and have included features that give an application's administrators direct control over the usage of the SDK with the application and the ability for the application itself to reject content that has been altered by an unauthorized party.

A basic premise of the core architecture of ZBiM is that web technologies expose a large number of possible vectors for attack, interception, and content tampering. From social engineering to technical issues that reveal vulnerabilities of the underlying application code, there are numerous ways a client application can be impacted. Rather than attempting to address every attack vector separately, we took a more robust approach by creating a secured walled-garden content experience that is delivered by a system that secures each step of the content's journey until it reaches the native application.

All metadata needed to verify the integrity of the content is exchanged over a secured network connection (TLS).  The metadata is then used to verify that the content itself has not been tampered with.  For these additional checks to work the application bundle needs to contain a Zumobi-provided file that contains a public key specific to each application. The name of the file is pubkey.der and it must be carried as a resource by your application bundle.

Once content has made it to the device and is ready to be consumed, ZBiM SDK will ensure that the major content types, i.e. hub, channel or article can only be loaded from the content bundle, whose integrity has already been verified. By default, the ZBiM SDK will allow external resources to still be accessed, e.g. fetching remote data, playing a YouTube video, etc. For applications that do not require access to external resources and/or have heightened security requirements, ZBiM SDK provides the option to deny access to any resource that's not part of the local content bundle. Thus, in the unlikely case where malicious code manages to sneak into a brand's Content Hub, any attempts to communicate with systems outside of the hub will be denied.  A goal of this architecture is to hold the branded content portion of the application to the same standard of trustworthy computing as other mission-critical, secured features within the existing application.

Deciding whether access to external resources is permitted or not is based on the value of the ZBiM's contentSource property. By default, its value is ZBiMContentSourceExternalAllowed. By changing it to ZBiMContentSourceLocalOnly the application can prevent the Content Hub from accessing any resources outside of the local content bundle's scope:

```objective-c
[ZBiM setContentSource:ZBiMContentSourceLocalOnly];
```

In addition to the above, ZBiM also provides the option to remotely shut down your specific implementation of the Content Hub, which prevents the hub from appearing within your application.  This gives the administrator the immediate ability to remove the Content Hubs from your application in the event that some inappropriate or unauthorized content was discovered.

Finally, for applications that want elevated security measures, but still need an occasional exception in terms of what is allowed (or not) to go through on the network, there is a hybrid option where contentSource is kept at ZBiMContentSourceLocalOnly, but individual URLs or whole domain names can be whitelisted. This allows the host application to inform the ZBiM SDK to not make these subject to the same security restrictions.
To whitelist a specific URL, the application must call ZBiM's whitelistURL method, e.g.:

```objective-c
[ZBiM whitelistURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.zumobi.com/about"]];
```

Please note that when a URL is checked against the list of whitelisted URLs, the entire URL, i.e. including any parameters, anchors, etc. will be used verbatim as provided to the method call above.

If the previous method is too restrictive, then the application has the option to whitelist an entire domain by calling ZBiM's whitelistDomainName method. Here's an example:

```objective-c
[ZBiM whitelistDomainName:@"www.zumobi.com"]];
```

<a id="CustomURLSchemesSupport"/>
## Custom URL Schemes Support

Custom URL schemes can be used to deep link into content provided by the SDK (discussed in next section) or to allow the SDK to communicate with the host application for the purpose of performing actions not supported directly by the SDK itself. For example, the Content Hub might be showing an item available for purchase, but only the application can perform the checkout action. If the user taps on the purchase button within the Content Hub, the ZBiM SDK will generate a custom URL request for the host application to handle the checkout functionality.

By default the ZBiM SDK will read all custom URL schemes (from the app-info.plist file) that the app has registered to handle and add them to a list of whitelisted URL schemes that are exempt from the security restrictions described in the previous section. The application can add more URL schemes that should be treated the same way by calling:

```objective-c
+ (void) registerCustomURLScheme:(NSString *)customURLScheme;
```

<a id="DeepLinkingSupport"/>
## Deep Linking and App Indexing Support

Deep linking refers to the process of presenting a specific piece of content identified by a URI that the host application passes as a parameter to ZBiM SDK. The host application can get the URI from a variety of sources, e.g. receiving a local notification, being asked to handle an incoming URL, etc. The application must then check if there is an existing Content Hub and if so ask it to load the new URI. Otherwise it can pass the URI as a parameter to one of the presentHubWithUri: methods which will create and present a new Content Hub.

For the above to work, the SDK must know how to handle the URI. In the case of local notifications that is not a problem, since the source of the notification is the SDK itself. When the application is asked to handle an incoming URL, e.g. in response to registering as a handler of a custom URL scheme, there are two things that are needed for the corresponding content to be presented successfully:

1. The application must replace the custom URL scheme with zbimdb:// before passing the resulting URI along to the SDK.
2. There must be a corresponding piece of content matching the resulting URI that the SDK can load, which is why these are typically Zumobi-provided URIs.

Finally, there is the case of app-indexing, where search engines crawl content that is available inside an application and which can later be presented by ZBiM SDK inside the application in response to a user request, e.g. tapping on a given item in Google search results. In this context, the host application will be asked to open a regular URL, which it can then pass straight to the SDK without having to change the URL's scheme. The incoming URL must reflect the original source of the content, i.e. the one indexed by the search engine and ingested by the Zumobi's crawler.

Any setup steps ensuring that the host application will be asked to handle a deep link are outside of ZBiM SDK's scope and must be handled by the application's developer. In this document we are going to provide pointers only to Google App Indexing specific tasks. Google's documentation on app indexing can be found here: https://developers.google.com/app-indexing/introduction. The following is a high-level summary:
1. Add Google App Indexing SDK.
2. Update application to initialize Google App Indexing SDK.
3. Implement support for Apple Universal Links (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppSearch/UniversalLinks.html):
  * Add apple-app-site-association file to the web site that hosts the content that is to be indexed.
  * Add an entitlement to the host application, specifying the domains the application supports.
  * Update the host application's AppDelegate, to respond appropriately to a NSUserActivity object.

<a id="Configuration"/>
## Configuration

The SDK is configured via a Zumobi-provided file called zbimconfig.plist, which is carried as a resource by the application bundle. It contains the following set of configuration entries:

1. dbServiceUrl - URL to content download service
2. appID - DB service ID needed for metrics reporting
3. metricsReportingQueueId, poolId, roleA, roleUA, accountID, regionName - used to initialize metrics reporting

<a id="Customizations"/>
## Customizations

There are several main aspects in which the ZBiM SDK's look and behavior can be customized. These are:

1. The Content Hub's default navigation chrome can be omitted entirely in favor of an application-provided one. This is achieved by nesting the Content Hub into a parent view and was already discussed in the Content Hub UI & Navigation Model section.

2. The Content Hub UI supports two different color schemes - dark (default) and light - allowing the application to choose which one fits better with the existing look and feel. The color schemes selection affects the Content Hub's navigation chrome as well as the built-in progress reporting and error messaging. Supported values for color schemes are ZBiMColorSchemeDark (default) and ZBiMColorSchemeLight. Application can query the current color scheme by calling:

  ```objective-c
  + (ZBiMColorScheme) colorScheme;
  ```
or it can set the active color scheme by calling:

  ```objective-c
  + (void) setColorScheme:(ZBiMColorScheme)colorScheme;
  ```

  The Content Hub UI can be further customized by calling ZBiMContentHubDelegate's setBackgroundColor: method, which allows the application to customize the background color for the Content Hub's embedded UIWebView:

  ```objective-c
  - (void) setBackgroundColor:(UIColor *)color;
  ```

3. The client application can register itself as a provider of status reporting views, which the Content Hub uses to communicate to the user one of three things - it is checking for new content, downloading new content or it has encountered an error. To do that, the host application needs a class implementing the ZBiMContentHubStatusUIDelegate protocol:

  ```objective-c
  @protocol ZBiMContentHubStatusUIDelegate <NSObject>
  - (UIView *) getErrorView:(NSString *)optionalMessage;
  - (UIView *) getCheckingForContentView:(NSString *)optionalMessage;
  - (UIView *) getDownloadProgressView:(NSString *)optionalMessage
                      percentCompleted:(CGFloat)percentCompleted;
  @optional
  - (UIImage *)getStatusCloseButtonImage;
  @end
  ```

  It then needs to register an instance of that class with the ZBiM SDK by calling:

  ```objective-c
  + (void) setCustomStatusUIDelegate:(id<ZBiMContentHubStatusUIDelegate>)delegate;
  ```

  When the Content Hub needs to present any of the three status reporting views it will call into the above mentioned object using one of the corresponding methods and passing as parameter data the application can use to construct/update the view. For example, when reporting download progress, the SDK will call with a default message of "Waiting for new content to be downloaded" and provide a percent-completed value, between 0.0 and 1.0. The application can then choose to use the data passed as parameters to update a label and a progress bar. Alternatively it can ignore it and show whatever makes most sense in the context of what it is doing.

4. The ZBiM SDK's logging severity and verbosity levels can be adjusted as well as the actual logging method, e.g. write to debug console or pop up a native dialog view. For more details see the Logging section later in this document.

5. While presenting content is typically perceived as instantaneous, there is still the case where no content has been previously downloaded, in which case the user will still be presented with the download-in-progress UI. The application has the option to avoid this by including a file named contentDB.sqlite3 as part of the application's main bundle. If present, content from the file will be loaded and presented to the user immediately, while new content is downloaded asynchronously. For that to work, the client application must use the default download mode of non-blocking.

6. The SDK allows the application to determine what constitutes a meaningful advertiser ID and pass the value back to the SDK to be used for reporting purposes. To take advantage of that customization option, the application must implement the ZBiMAdvertiserIdDelegate protocol and set itself as the corresponding advertiser ID delegate.

<a id="ZBIMSDKStateChanges"/>
## Reacting to ZBiM SDK State Changes

ZBiM SDK provides limited access to internal state-related information that host application can use to adjust UI to improve the user experience. This section describes publicly accessible state information and provides examples of how it can be used.

The following five methods allow access to a subset of ZBiM SDK internal states.

1. Indicates whether content source related metadata or content source itself is being currently downloaded:

  ```objective-c
  + (BOOL) isDownloadingContent;
  ```

2. Indicates if Content Hub is currently being displayed. It provides no information regarding what the hub is showing, i.e. actual content, progress indicator or error status:

  ```objective-c
  + (BOOL) isDisplayingContentHub;
  ```

3. Indicates whether SDK is ready to show content. Implies that a valid content has been already downloaded and validated and is ready to be presented.

  ```objective-c
  + (BOOL) isReady;
  ```

4. Indicates whether SDK has been shutdown remotely (typically as a security precaution):

  ```objective-c
  + (BOOL) isDisabled;
  ```

5. Indicates whether ZBiM SDK is not part of a pilot program, either because it was not allowed to joint or because it lost its membership as part of a pilot program update. The property is set to YES only when access to a pilot program has been denied. If ZBiM SDK is part of an existing pilot program or there's no pilot program, then it's set to NO.

  ```objective-c
  + (BOOL) notPartOfPilotProgram;
  ```

Please note that more than one of the above can return true simultaneously, e.g. content might be downloading while the Content Hub is being presented, but there's previously downloaded valid content, so the ZBiM SDK is in a "ready" state.

For each of the above-mentioned states there is a notification that client code can subscribe to if it needs to know when the corresponding state changes. The notifications' names are:

1. ZBiMDownloadingContentStateChanged
2. ZBiMDisplayingContentHubStateChanged
3. ZBiMReadyStateChanged
4. ZBiMDisabledStateChanged
5. ZBiMNotPartOfPilotProgramStateChanged

One example of how the application can take advantage of the above is by showing or hiding the entry point (e.g. a button) to the Content Hub. If the ZBiM SDK has been remotely disabled, we know the application will not download and display a Content Hub for the remainder of the application session. In such a scenario, the entry point can be hidden altogether until any security concerns have been resolved to provide the user with a more seamless app experience until the Content Hub is again accessible.

<a id="AdaptiveApplicationUI"/>
## Facilitating an Adaptive Application UI

In addition to state-related information, the ZBiM SDK can notify host application when certain events of interest take place. This allows the application to adapt its UI in order to provide a more seamless ZBiM SDK integration and is achieved via the following two notifications:

1. ZBiMDBDownloadProgressChanged
2. ZBiMContentTypeChanged

ZBiM SDK also provides access to the Content Hub's raw scroll events.

If the application needs to visualize the content download progress, it can subscribe to the ZBiMDBDownloadProgressChanged notification. The NSNotification object's userInfo property bag contains a float value between 0.0 and 100.0, identified by the ZBiMDownloadProgressValue constant. The event will be fired every time when there's a notable change in download progress.

ZBiM SDK also allows an application-provided class to set itself as a UIScrollViewDelegate to the UIWebView that renders the Content Hub. This is targeted primarily at the nested mode, where the Content Hub is presented inside a parent view. By getting access to the raw scrolling events, the parent view can implement behaviors such as hiding and showing the navigation chrome depending on the scroll direction. A sample implementation can be found as part of the ZBiM Sample Application's source code.

To set a class as a UIScrollViewDelegate, the application needs to call the following ZBiMContentHubDelegate's method:

```objective-c
- (void) setScrollDelegate:(id<UIScrollViewDelegate>)delegate;
```

Finally, the application can subscribe for the ZBiMContentTypeChanged notification, which gets triggered every time the Content Hub navigates to a new piece of content. The notification's payload includes three pieces of information:

1. Content type indicates whether a hub, channel or article is being loaded and is represented by the ZBiMResourceTypeHub, ZBiMResourceTypeChannel and ZBiMResourceTypeArticle enum values.
2. Content URL provides a way to identify and locate the specific piece of content.
3. Content title is a UI-friendly string that can be used elsewhere in the host application to describe the content being loaded.

By monitoring for changes to the currently loaded content item, the application can implement, for example, conditional logic to disable the hiding and showing animation for the navigation chrome when user is reading an article and re-enable it when user navigates back to channel or hub views. It can also extract the content's title and include it as part of its UI. A sample implementation of the above-mentioned scenario can be found in the ZBiM Sample App's source code.

<a id="Logging"/>
## Logging

Logging is designed to be pretty flexible, allowing the client application to decide what gets logged and how.

The client application can set the logging delegate by calling:

```objective-c
+ (void)setLoggingDelegate:(id<ZBiMLoggingDelegate>)loggingDelegate;
```

The client application also has the option to set the logging severity and verbosity levels via:

```objective-c
+ (void) setSeverityLevel:(ZBiMSeverityLevel)severityLevel;
+ (void) setVerbosityLevel:(ZBiMVerbosityLevel)verbosityLevel;
```

And to query the currently set values via:

```objective-c
+ (ZBiMSeverityLevel) severityLevel;
+ (ZBiMVerbosityLevel) verbosityLevel;
```

The values for logging severity are:

```objective-c
ZBiMLogSeverityNone
ZBiMLogSeverityCriticalError
ZBiMLogSeverityError
ZBiMLogSeverityWarning
ZBiMLogSeverityInfo
```

The values for logging verbosity are:

```objective-c
ZBiMLogVerbosityNone
ZBiMLogVerbosityDebug
ZBiMLogVerbosityInfo
```

The severity and verbosity levels determine what information will be logged and what ignored even before the SDK checks if a logging delegate has been set. By default severity is set to ZBiMLogSeverityError and verbosity to ZBiMLogVerbosityDebug. If either the severity or verbosity parameter value is lower than the currently set levels the call will be ignored. The stacking of the different values is per the ordered lists above. Setting either the severity or verbosity to none (e.g. ZBiMLogSeverityNone or ZBiMLogVerbosityNone) will have the effect of turning logging off.

If the application code wants full access over everything that is to be logged, then it can set severity and verbosity to the least restrictive values, i.e. ZBiMLogSeverityInfo and ZBiMLogVerbosityAlert correspondingly, and do all filtering inside the logging delegate object.

<a id="Metrics"/>
## Metrics

The ZBiM SDK has an onboard metrics collection system that enables marketers to measure the performance of the various pieces of content and the interaction history of the user against the Content Hub for segmentation purposes.  The SDK will periodically upload collected metrics to a cloud-based reporting system over a secured connection for marketing analysis.  This secured, on-device metrics system is designed to work over mobile networks and is resilient against network interruptions or if the user puts his/her device into "airplane" mode.  

For metrics collection to work properly, the client application must provide the reporting queue ID in the zbimconfig.plist file, whose value is to be assigned by Zumobi.

One metrics-related attribute that deserves special attention is the advertiser ID. As part of metrics reporting the ZBiM SDK collects the advertiser ID based on the user's OS preferences which can later be used for remarketing campaigns. For example, ZBiM SDK collects the current IDFA value, but only if user has not limited ad tracking (via Settings->Privacy->Advertising->Limit Ad Tracking). If Limit Ad Tracking is turned on, then ZBiM SDK will not use the advertiser ID at all. This default behavior supported by the SDK can be overridden by the host application if desired.  The application can simply provide its own behavior by implementing the ZBiMAdvertiserIdDelegate protocol and setting itself as the advertiser ID delegate by calling:

```objective-c
+ (void) setAdvertiserIdDelegate:(id<ZBiMAdvertiserIdDelegate>)advertiserIdDelegate;
```

<a id="LocalNotifications"/>
## Local Notifications

ZBiM SDK supports scheduling of local notifications on behalf of the client application. Metadata describing when a local notification is to be scheduled, as well as what its message and action should be are provided via the ZBiM Portal.

There are only a couple of things an application needs to do in order to enable local notifications support:

1. If the application supports iOS 8 and later, it must register to receive local notifications. From Apple's documentation:

  "In iOS 8 and later, apps that use either local or remote notifications must register the types of notifications they intend to deliver."

  Here is an example (from ZBiMAppDelegate.m) of how the ZBiM Sample Application implements this requirement:

  ```objective-c
  #if __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED >= __IPHONE_8_0
      // In iOS 8 and later, the application must explicitly
      // register for notifications.
      if ([application respondsToSelector:@selector(registerUserNotificationSettings:)])
      {
          [application registerUserNotificationSettings:[UIUserNotificationSettings settingsForTypes:UIUserNotificationTypeAlert categories:nil]];
      }
  #endif
  ```

2. The native application also needs to implement the standard methods for handling local notifications, e.g.:

  ```objective-c
  - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions;

  - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveLocalNotification:(UILocalNotification *)notification;
  ```

Once a local notification has been received, the application can pass it to ZBiM SDK for handling by calling one of the following methods:

```objective-c
+ (BOOL) handleLocalNotification:(UILocalNotification *)notification;
+ (BOOL) handleLocalNotification:(UILocalNotification *)notification showAlert:(BOOL)showAlert;
```

If the local notification was not scheduled by ZBiM SDK, the above-mentioned methods will return NO and let the application handle the notifications as it deems appropriate.

The first of the local notification handling methods is just a convenience wrapper for the second, calling it with showAlert set to YES. The case where handleLocalNotifications should be called with showAlert set to NO is if the user has already expressed interest in actioning on the local notification, e.g. from the notification bar. This tells ZBiM SDK that there is no need to show a prompt, asking the user if they want to action on the notification, but it should go straight to executing the action.
